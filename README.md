I used the website above to run my first machine learning project. 

Data set:

Iris dataset

What I learned: In this supervised learning machine learning project, I learned that we need to consider many different models when looking at the best way to make predictions. We used 6 in this example. We do to this to compare them as we want the strongest relationships between variables as these are the ones we can use to estimate with greater certainty. With Machine Learning, we use part of our data set to build our algorithm, and then a smaller portion to use in our validation testing. It appears much of the value comes from the ability to use past data in order to make more precise predictions about future behavior of the variables.
